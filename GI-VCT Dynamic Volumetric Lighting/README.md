# Global Illumination using Voxel Cone Tracing and a Dynamic Volumetric Light

This demo shows the effect of using Voxel Cone Tracing to approximate Global Illumination on the Sponza scene (courtesy of Crytek http://www.crytek.com/cryengine/cryengine3/downloads).
This demo also shows the effect of using particles and volumetric lighting to simulate a dynamic smoke effect.

This demo is based on the work from:
- Crassin et al.: Interactive indirect illumination using voxel cone tracing
- Nathan Vos: Volumetric light effects in killzone: Shadow fall (GPU Pro 5)

> **Some features:**

> - Deferred Shading
> - Voxelization into a 3D texture
> - Reflective Shadow Maps
> - Using Compute Shaders
> - Particle effects simulated using Transform Feedback
> - Dynamic Volumetric Lighting based on Atmospheric Scattering effects
> - Voxel Cone Tracing
