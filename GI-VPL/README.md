# Global Illumination using Virtual Point Lights

This demo shows the effect of applying Virtual Point Lights to the Sponza scene (courtesy of Crytek http://www.crytek.com/cryengine/cryengine3/downloads) in order to obtain approximate Global Illumination.

This demo is based on the work from Hawar Doghramachi: Rasterized voxel-based dynamic global illumination (GPU Pro 4)

> **Some features:**

> - Deferred Shading
> - Voxelization into a 3D texture
> - Virtual Point Lights encoded with Spherical Harmonics
> - Reflective Shadow Maps
> - Using Compute Shaders
